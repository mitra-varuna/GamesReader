# GamesReader

A Julia Package to read game files in `.nfg` format. `.nfg` format is used to
represent games in normal form [NFG file format for games](http://www.gambit-project.org/gambit13/formats.html#the-strategic-game-nfg-file-format-payoff-version).

The idea is to interface this library with the [Game theory Julia Package](https://github.com/QuantEcon/Games.jl).
